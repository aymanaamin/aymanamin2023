## Data Availability
All the simulated and real datasets used in this paper are available here, and can be downloaded.

### Simulated Datasets
We simulate 1,000 time series datasets from each of four SAR models, aiming to cover different seasonality patterns.

### Real Dataset
The real time series dataset that we consider in our application is the monthly Federal Reserve Board (FRB) production index, starting from January 1948 to December 1978.
